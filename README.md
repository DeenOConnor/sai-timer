# sai-timer
A small and simple program to measure time spent in SAI and/or SAI2

This was made on request, and i'm not planning on updating this unless there's a random event that will attract significant amounts of people to this program.


# Build
I built this with DUB, but you are free to use any tool you want.

To build this, you need to add DLangUI to your project.

You can do this in dub.json by pasting the following line in your "dependencies" section:

`"dlangui": "~>0.9.186"`
