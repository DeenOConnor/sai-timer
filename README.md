# sai-timer
A small and simple program to measure time spent in SAI, SAI2, Krita or MediBangPaintPro.

This was made on request, updated on request, and i'm still not planning on updating this unless there's a bug/feature i'm explicitly asked to deal with, or a random event that will attract significant amounts of people to this program. In case of that, i'll probably bother myself with adding some cosmetic features and maybe properly design the UI.


# Build
I built this with DUB, but you are free to use any tool you want.

To build this, you need to add DLangUI to your project.

You can do this in dub.json by pasting the following line in your "dependencies" section:

`"dlangui": "~>0.9.186"`
